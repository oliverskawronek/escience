h1. Redmine Doodles

A doodle module for redmine, a doodle in this case being a collection of simple yes-no questions.

h2. Installation

Generic Redmine plugin installation instructions can be found in the "Redmine wiki":http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins#Installing-a-plugin.

For the impatient: go to your redmine directory, run the following commands and restart redmine:

<pre>git clone https://git.fachschaften.org/redmine_doodles
rake db:migrate_plugins RAILS_ENV=production</pre>

Remember to go to the permissions page and give permissions to create and answer doodles as needed!
